## Python Development Projects

This section showcases my Python development projects, where I leverage programming to solve real-world challenges through web development, automation, and innovative tech solutions.

[Microblog Application](https://github.com/vandithavb/microblog-python-web)  
Built a microblogging app using Flask and MongoDB for backend, with HTML and CSS for a responsive frontend. Enabled users to create, display, and manage blog entries. Integrated backend logic for real-time updates.  

[Habit Tracker App](https://github.com/vandithavb/HabitTracker)  
Developed a habit tracker app that allows users to add, view, and complete daily habits. Integrated MongoDB for data persistence and used Flask blueprints to ensure modular structure. Managed environment variables securely with dotenv.

[Hand Gesture Recognition](https://github.com/vandithavb/git-repo)  
Created a hand gesture recognition solution using Python, employing convexity
defects and background subtraction techniques. The project has real-life applications in smart device communication
and developing assistive solutions for differently-abled individuals.

## Data Analysis Projects

This section highlights my data analysis projects, where I dive into datasets to uncover insights, discover patterns, and visualize results that drive informed decision-making.

I encourage you to explore the **[full data analysis project folder here](https://github.com/vandithavb/Data_Analysis_Projects)**, where you'll find all of my data analysis work, with detailed insights and visualizations.

[Movie Data Correlation Analysis](https://github.com/vandithavb/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Movie%20Data%20Correlation%20Analysis)  
Performed data analysis on a Kaggle movie dataset using Python to identify significant correlations and trends. Processed the data with pandas, calculated correlations, and visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn through scatter plots and heatmaps.

[Bellabeat Smart Device Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/vandithavb/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Smart%20Device%20Data%20Analysis)  
This project analyzes Bellabeat smart device data using R programming, exploring user activity, sleep patterns, and wellness trends to provide insights and actionable recommendations for product improvements and growth opportunities.
  
## Data Engineering Projects

In this section, you'll find a project that highlights my work in building ETL pipelines and designing efficient, cloud-based solutions to streamline data workflows and deliver impactful insights.

[ETL Pipeline using Spotify API and AWS](https://github.com/vandithavb/Spotify-end-to-end-ETL-data-Pipeline--AWS)  
Built an automated ETL pipeline using AWS to extract, transform, and load data from the Spotify API. The project utilized services such as Lambda, S3, Glue, Athena, and CloudWatch to provide scalable, real-time insights for professionals.
